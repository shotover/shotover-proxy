# This exists as a seperate workflow because pull_request workflows dont have permission to write comments

# How to use:
# 1. Add the name of the workflow that needs to leave a comment under on -> workflow_run -> workflows
# 2. In the main workflow always upload an artifact folder named comment_info
# 3. If a comment should be written then:
#    1. include issue_number.txt in the artifact folder containing the issue_number 
#    2. include message.txt in the artifact folder containing the message of the comment
