          # benefits:
          # * prevents main branch caches from being evicted in favor of a PR cache
          # * saves about 1min per workflow by skipping the actual cache write
          # downsides:
          # * PRs that update rust version or changes deps will be slow to iterate on due to changes not being cached.
