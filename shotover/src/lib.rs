//! This library allows the creation of custom shotover transforms.
//!
//! There are two consumers of this library:
//! ## Custom Transforms
//!
//! To create a custom transform you need to implement these traits:
//! * [`transforms::TransformConfig`] - Defines what configuration fields the transform has in the `topology.yaml`.
//! * [`transforms::TransformBuilder`] - Defines how to build the Transform for a new incoming connection. Only one instance is created over shotovers runtime.
//! * [`transforms::Transform`] - Defines the transformation logic of the transform. A new instance is created per incoming connection.
//!
//! Simple transforms can implement all of these onto a single struct but generally you need seperate structs for each.
//!
//! ## The shotover binary
//! All custom transforms the user wants to use are statically compiled into a single binary.
//! The crate for this binary is very simple, it just consists of a `main.rs` like:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # mod transform_crate {
//! # pub type TransformConfig = shotover::transforms::null::NullSinkConfig;
//! # }
//! shotover::import_transform!(transform_crate::TransformConfig);
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     shotover::runner::Shotover::new().run_block();
//! }
//! ```
//!

// Accidentally printing would break json log output

/// When a custom transform is defined in its own crate, typetag wont kick in unless there is some kind of `use crate_name::CustomTransformConfig`.

/// It also performs some type checks to ensure that you are actually importing an implementer of [`transforms::TransformConfig`].
