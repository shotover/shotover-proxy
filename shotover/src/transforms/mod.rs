/// This trait is the primary extension point for Shotover-proxy.
/// A [`Transform`] is a struct that implements the Transform trait and enables you to modify and observe database
/// queries or frames.
/// The trait has one method where you implement the majority of your logic [Transform::transform],
/// however it also includes a setup and naming method.
///
/// Transforms are created on a per TCP connection basis by calling `TransformBuilder::build()`.
/// This means that each member of your struct that implements this trait can be considered private for
/// each TCP connection or connected client. If you wish to share data between all copies of your struct
/// then wrapping a member in an [`Arc<Mutex<_>>`](std::sync::Mutex) will achieve that,
/// but make sure to copy the value from the TransformBuilder to ensure all instances are referring to the same value.
///
/// Once you have created your [`Transform`], you will need to implement the [TransformBuilder] and [TransformConfig] traits
/// to make them configurable in Shotover.
/// Implementing this trait is usually done using `#[async_trait]` macros.

    /// * contained in chain_state.requests
    ///     + these are the requests that will flow into the next transform in the chain.
    /// * contained in the return value of `chain_state.call_next_transform()`
    ///     + These are the responses that will flow back to the previous transform in the chain.
    ///
    /// But while doing so, also make sure to follow the below invariants when modifying the messages.
    ///
    /// # Invariants
    ///
    /// * Non-terminating specific invariants
    ///     + If your transform does not send the message to an external system or generate its own response to the query,
    /// it will need to call and return the response from `chain_state.call_next_transform()`.
    ///     + This ensures that your transform will call any subsequent downstream transforms without needing to know about what they
    /// do. This type of transform is called a non-terminating transform.
    ///
    /// * Terminating specific invariants
    ///     + Your transform can also choose not to call `chain_state.call_next_transform()` if it sends the
    /// messages to an external system or generates its own response to the query e.g. `CassandraSinkSingle`.
    ///     + This type of transform is called a Terminating transform (as no subsequent transforms in the chain will be called).
    ///
    /// * Request/Response invariants:
    ///     + Transforms must ensure that each request that passes through the transform has a corresponding response returned for it.
    ///         - A response/request pair can be identified by calling `request_id()` on a response and matching that to the `id()` of a previous request.
    ///         - The response does not need to be returned within the same call to [`Transform::transform`] that the request was encountered.
    ///           But it must be returned eventually over the lifetime of the transform.
    ///         - If a transform deletes a request it must return a simulated response message with its request_id set to the deleted request.
    ///             * For in order protocols: this simulated message must be in the correct location within the list of responses
    ///                 - The best way to achieve this is storing the [`crate::message::MessageId`] of the message before the deleted message.
    ///         - If a transform introduces a new request into the chain_state the response must be located and
    ///           removed from the list of returned responses.
    ///     + For in order protocols, transforms must ensure that responses are kept in the same order in which they are received.
    ///         - When writing protocol generic transforms: always ensure this is upheld.
    ///         - When writing a transform specific to a protocol that is out of order: you can disregard this requirement
    ///             * This is currently only cassandra
    ///
    /// * Err response:
    ///     + When [`Transform::transform`] returns `Err`, shotover will never call [`Transform::transform`] on this transform instance again
    ///       and will close the connection with the client after attempting to generate error responses for any pending requests.
    ///       So it is ok to leave the transform in an invalid state when returning `Err`.
    ///
    /// # Naming
    /// Transform also have different naming conventions.
    /// * Transform that interact with an external system are called Sinks.
    /// * Transform that don't call subsequent chains via `chain_state.call_next_transform()` are called terminating transforms.
    /// * Transform that do call subsquent chains via `chain_state.call_next_transform()` are non-terminating transforms.
