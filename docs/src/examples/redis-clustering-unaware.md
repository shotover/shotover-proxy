# Redis Clustering

The following guide shows you how to configure Shotover Proxy to support transparently proxying Redis cluster _unaware_ clients to a [Redis cluster](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).

## Setting up the Redis cluster

First you need to setup a Redis cluster for Shotover to connect to.

The easiest way to do this is with this example [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/shotover/shotover-proxy/blob/main/shotover-proxy/example-configs-docker/redis-cluster-hiding/docker-compose.yaml)
You should first inspect the `docker-compose.yaml` to understand what the cluster looks like and how its exposed to the network.

Then run:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shotover/shotover-proxy/main/shotover-proxy/example-configs/redis-cluster-hiding/docker-compose.yaml --output docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
```

When you are finished with the containers <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> will shut them down.

Alternatively you could spin up a hosted Redis cluster on [any cloud provider that provides it](https://www.instaclustr.com/products/managed-redis).
This more accurately reflects a real production use but will take a bit more setup.

## Configuration

Modify your `topology.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
{{#include ../../../shotover-proxy/example-configs-docker/redis-cluster-hiding/topology.yaml}}
```

If you didnt use the standard `docker-compose.yaml` setup then you will need to change `first_contact_points` to point to the Redis instances you used.

## Testing

With your Redis Cluster and Shotover now up and running, we can test out our client application. Let's start it up!

```console
redis-benchmark -t set,get
```

Running against local containerised Redis instances on a Ryzen 9 3900X we get the following:

```console
user@demo ~$ redis-benchmark -t set,get
